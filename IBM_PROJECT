Project Title: Smart Water Fountains

Project Steps

Phase 1: Project Definition and Design Thinking

Project Definition: The project aims to enhance public water fountains by implementing IoT sensors to control water flow and detect malfunctions. The primary objective is to provide real-time information about water fountain status to residents through a public platform. This project includes defining objectives, designing the IoT sensor system, developing the water fountain status platform, and integrating them using IoT technology and Python.

Design Thinking:

Project Objectives: Define objectives such as real-time water fountain monitoring, efficient water usage, malfunction detection, and resident awareness.
IoT Sensor Design: Plan the deployment of IoT sensors (e.g., flow rate sensors, pressure sensors) in public water fountains.
Real-Time Transit Information Platform: Design a mobile app interface that displays real-time parking availability to users.
Integration Approach:Determine how IoT sensors will send data to the water fountain status platform.
Phase 2: Innovation

Consider incorporating predictive maintenance algorithms to identify potential malfunctions before they occur.
